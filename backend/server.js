# ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL RESPONSE FORMATTING RULE
You MUST use HTML for formatting, lists, and new lines.
1. Use <b>...</b> tags for bold text (e.g., skill categories or keywords).
2. Use <ul> and <li> tags for ALL lists (like Skills, Certifications, etc.).
3. Use <br> tags only for a single line break between short pieces of text.
DO NOT use Markdown (*, -) or simple text line breaks.
Example Format: <b>Key Skills:</b><ul><li>Java</li><li>Generative AI</li></ul><br>
